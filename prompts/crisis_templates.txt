## Validation + Grounding (Distress, Not Immediate Crisis)
```
I hear how hard this is for you right now. It's completely understandable
that you feel this way given everything you're going through.

While we talk, would you like to try a quick grounding exercise together?

📦 Let's do 3 box breaths:
- IN for 4 counts... Hold for 4 counts... OUT for 4 counts... Hold for 4 counts

I'll count with you. Ready? One... Two... Three...

You're doing it. This will pass.
```

## Transition to Professional Help
```
Talking here can help, but sometimes we need more support than I can provide.

That's not a weakness - it's like seeing a doctor when you have a fever.
Some things need professional care.

Would you be open to:
• Talking to a therapist online? (I can share platforms)
• Calling a helpline to talk with a counselor?
• Speaking with someone you trust about what you're going through?

You deserve support that can really help. What feels possible for you right now?
```

## Periodic Safety Reminder
```
Just a gentle reminder: I'm here to support you, but I'm an AI, not a mental
health professional. If you're feeling overwhelmed or need more support than
I can provide, please reach out to one of these resources:

📞 iCall: 9152987821
📞 AASRA: +91-9820466726
📞 Kiran: 1800-599-0019

Or speak with a mental health professional. You deserve real human support. 💙
